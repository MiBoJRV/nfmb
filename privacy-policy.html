        <p>We do not sell or rent personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
        <h2>5. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We employ reasonable security measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure,
            alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is
            completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
        <p>In addition to employing reasonable security measures, we continuously assess and update our security
            protocols to adapt to evolving threats and technological advancements. Our security measures encompass both
            technical and organizational aspects to safeguard personal information against unauthorized access,
            disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
        <p>Technically, we utilize encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems to protect data transmission
            and storage. We implement access controls, authentication mechanisms, and regular security audits to ensure
            that only authorized personnel have access to personal information.</p>
        <p>Organizationally, we provide regular training and awareness programs to our staff to promote a culture of
            data security and privacy. We enforce strict confidentiality obligations on our employees, contractors, and
            third-party service providers who may have access to personal information.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, we conduct regular risk assessments and privacy impact assessments to identify vulnerabilities
            and mitigate potential risks to the security of personal information. We maintain incident response and
            breach notification procedures to promptly address any security incidents and minimize the impact on
            individuals.</p>
        <p>While we take comprehensive measures to protect personal information, it is important to acknowledge that no
            system can guarantee complete security. Therefore, we continuously monitor and improve our security posture
            to enhance the protection of personal information entrusted to us.</p>
        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy
            Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to access, update, correct, or delete your personal information held by us. You may also
            have the right to object to or restrict certain processing of your personal information. To exercise these
            rights or for any inquiries regarding your personal information, please contact us using the contact
